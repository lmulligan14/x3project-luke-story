On a very tall hill near a very small town stood a cottage, and in this
cottage lived a man named Harry, who was incredibley hairy. From head to
to he was covered in hair, you could barely even seen the white of his eyes.
No one from the village ever visited Harry, because he never showered, and
smelled terrible.

However, Harry never felt lonely. As Harry's hair was so soft and furry, 
many birds came to him and built nests on his hair. These birds loved Harry
so much because Harry's hair provided such a warm and cozy home for them.
Harry also enjoyed living with these birds. Whenever Harry felt bored, these 
birds would talk to him and share funny stories with him. They soon became 
good friends.
