On a very tall hill near a very small town stood a cottage, and in this
cottage lived a man named Harry, who was incredibley hairy. From head to
to he was covered in hair, you could barely even seen the white of his eyes.
No one from the village ever visited Harry, because he never showered, and
smelled terrible.
