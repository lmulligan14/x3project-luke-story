On a very tall hill near a very small town stood a cottage, and in this
cottage lived a man named Harry, who was incredibley hairy. From head to
to he was covered in hair, you could barely even seen the white of his eyes.
No one from the village ever visited Harry, because he never showered, and
smelled terrible.

However, Harry never felt lonely. As Harry's hair was so soft and furry, 
many birds came to him and built nests on his hair. These birds loved Harry
so much because Harry's hair provided such a warm and cozy home for them.
Harry also enjoyed living with these birds. Whenever Harry felt bored, these 
birds would talk to him and share funny stories with him. They soon became 
good friends.

Harry loves his new friends, and surely his new friends all love him too.
They are always together everywhere they go. One day, an evil man came to
the town. He's so evil and greedy such that he wants to take all of Harry's
birds and sell them for money. So one night, he got into Harry's home. Sneaking
into Harry's bedroom, and the birds were not with him!

Luckily, the police department has been watching at the evil for months. When 
evil entered the house, the policemen appeared in a sudden, and arrested the evil
immediately. Thanks to the quick response, Harry and his lovely birds become safe
again.
